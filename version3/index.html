<center><p>Forever pasta! This would likely be the one food that we could consume endlessly. There, we are aware that we are not alone. This is where you go if you want the best spaghetti in Auckland, without a doubt. Every day, Slice of ItalyÂ produces their own fresh pasta, and it is exquisite. High bar stools inside allow you to sip noir from a vineyard while people-watching the crowds of people outside. The ideal balance, since elegant tables further inside will soon be filled with platters of homemade pasta. Yes, you're watching the skilled chefs make fresh pasta by rolling, flattening, and cooking it in front of you. You won't regret it if you serve it with your preferred sauce along with some bruschetta to start. </p></center>
